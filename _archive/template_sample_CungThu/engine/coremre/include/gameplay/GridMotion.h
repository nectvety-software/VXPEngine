/**
 * @file GridMotion.h
 * @brief One actor's position while it travels from one grid cell to the next.
 *
 * `GridMotion` holds the LOGICAL cell (the one every gameplay rule reads), the
 * cell currently being travelled to, and a sub-cell progress counter. The four
 * functions here advance that state and project it to a world position. That
 * is the whole capability.
 *
 * What is deliberately NOT here, because it diverges between any two actors
 * that move on a grid and would have to arrive as callbacks:
 *
 * - **Whether a cell may be entered.** A player checking a bomb it just
 *   dropped and an enemy checking the same bomb answer differently.
 * - **Where the next direction comes from.** Held input, an AI draw, a
 *   scripted push — unrelated sources.
 * - **What happens on arrival.** `tickStep()` reports the arrival edge; the
 *   caller decides what it means.
 * - **Input buffering.** No consumer buffers direction input: a grid actor
 *   samples its direction at rest and ignores it in flight, so a queue would
 *   be state nobody reads.
 *
 * Shares `PIXELROOT32_ENABLE_GAMEPLAY_GRID_SPACE` with GridSpace rather than
 * taking a flag of its own: interpolatedWorld() takes a `GridSpec`, so
 * "motion without space" is not a reachable configuration and a second flag
 * would only widen the build matrix.
 *
 * @code
 * // Per logic step, in the actor:
 * if (isMoving(mv)) {
 *     if (tickStep(mv, kStepsPerCell)) { onArrive(mv.cellX, mv.cellY); }
 * } else if (wantsToMove && canEnter(nx, ny)) {   // canEnter is game code
 *     beginStep(mv, nx, ny);
 * }
 * position = interpolatedWorld(mv, kStepsPerCell, kGrid);
 * @endcode

 * @brief World position of the actor, interpolated across the current step.

 * an arrival lands exactly on the destination cell with no accumulated
 * residue.
 *
 * The lerp truncates toward zero rather than flooring, and that is deliberate
 * — it is NOT the negative-coordinate hazard `worldToCellX()` guards against.
 * Truncation makes the drawn position lag the exact position by under one
 * pixel *symmetrically* in both directions of travel; flooring would make
 * rightward moves lag while leftward moves lead.
 *
 * Costs one integer division per axis per call (`stepsPerCell` is a runtime
 * value, so it cannot be strength-reduced the way GridSpace's division-free
 * conversions are). Callers that need it cheaper can call it once per frame
 * and cache, which is what an actor's update already does.
