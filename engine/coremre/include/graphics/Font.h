/**
 * @struct Font
 * @brief Descriptor for a bitmap font using 1bpp sprites.
 *
 * A Font contains an array of Sprite structures, one for each character
 * in the font's character set. Each glyph is rendered as a 1bpp sprite,
 * allowing consistent rendering across platforms.
 *
 * The font uses fixed-width glyphs for simplicity and performance.
 * All glyphs share the same width and height, with spacing between
 * characters controlled by the `spacing` field.
 *
 * @note Font data should be stored in flash memory (const/constexpr)
 *       to minimize RAM usage on embedded systems.
 * @note Include "Renderer.h" when using Font in implementation files
 *       to get the full Sprite definition.
